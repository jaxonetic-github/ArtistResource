# Documentation
I started with [PropDoc](https://alligator.io/vuejs/propdoc-document-components/) and changed to [jsDoc](http://usejsdoc.org/) which is more universal and less Vue.js specific.  I had to add [jsdoc-vue](https://github.com/QingWei-Li/jsdoc-vue) to allow JsDoc to be able to parse Vue single file components.

All the jsdoc arguments are in  the jsDocConfig json file.

Documentation is created by running...
>>node_modules/.bin/jsdoc  -c  config/jsDocConfig.json
